# ElevenLabs-Simple-TTS
Just a simple program that uses the ElevenLabs text to speech AI. All it does is take a string and output the audio. 
Code is a simpler version of lugia19's code. Here is the link to their code: https://github.com/lugia19/elevenlabslib

Intructions: 
pip install these:
  pip install requires.io
  pip install elevenlabslib
  pip install pydub
 
 In the .py replace these with your own information:
 API_KEY -> the api key EleveLabs gives you as a string.
 VOICE_NAME -> the name of the voice you want to use. Example: Rachel. This works for custom voices as well. It must be a string
 WORDS -> what you want the ai voice to say as a string.
 
 That's Everything! Now you can use the AI in your own code :D
